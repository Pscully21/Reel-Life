## Description
Welcome to Reel-Life. An App I am making and designing for the avid outdoorsman. This application is designed to help every tier of fisherman, from newbie to the most experienced of anglers. Reel-Life will help anglers with real-time weather data for waters across New York State. From air pressure to water temperatures, the smallest detail could lead to a world of difference in making sure you are using the proper gear and techniques to catch that story worthy fish. Reel-Life would also provide fish information pertaining to New York State Regulations for each fish you search to keep you up to date and in the know. The abiltiy to snap a picture(or Video!) of your catch and share it with others who use Reel-Life will be a feature eventually so you can show off your catch. The roadmap for this project will be added in the coming days with plans and announcements on updates to come with Reel-Life
